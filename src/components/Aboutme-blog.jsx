      <p>
        Throughout my time at Enspiral Dev Acadamy's web development course we
        were encoruaged to create and update a blog like this with interesting
        findings from web development related research, posts about aspects of
        various web stack technologies, or guides on using different pieces of
        HTML, CSS, or Javascript code. All with the purpose of consolodating our
        understanding in what we were learning and allowing us to have an avenue
        to come back and 'freshen up' on anything we'd written a post about
        (after all it's easier to go back and refresh yourself if the content is
        written in your own words).

      <p>This is the second iteration of this blog</p>
