      <h2>About this blog</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my time at Enspiral Dev Acadamy's web development course we
        were encouraged to create and update a blog like this with interesting
        findings from web development related research, posts about various
        aspects of web stack technologies, and guides on using different pieces
        of HTML, CSS, or Javascript code. The purpose of this was to consolodate
        our understanding of what we were learning and to provide us with an
        avenue to come back and 'freshen up' on anything we'd written a post
        about (after all it's easier to go back and refresh yourself if the
        content is written in your own words).

        Within this blog you'll find three types of posts; technical, emotional,
        and "mini projects". As the name implies, a technical post will be a
        post containing technical content on technology related research, web
        stack technologies, or code guides. Emotional posts are written from an
        emotional intelligence lens and may consist of anything from learning
        reflections to neurological growth concepts. finally, "mini projects"
        consist of small pieces of functionality that I decided to play around
        and experiment with that were suitable to imbed within this project. All
        posts with the exception of "mini projects" are stored within a SQL
        database.

        This is the second iteration of this blog. The first was written in the
        early days of my web development journey and consisted of little to no
        modern web stack technologies. In an attempt to give myself another side
        project to work, and as a place to test and house future
        "mini-projects", I decided to completely revamp the blog. This is the
        ever-evolving output.
